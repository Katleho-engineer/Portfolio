                    I was doing my practical required by the University of Cape Town. While there I was tasked with
                    designing parts using Solidworks. I also had to present the calculations I did use Mathcad, to
                    show the strength and mass of my design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was told that a lot of parts have to be mechanically tested before they are sold. Because I love
                    programming. I was able to code an algorithm that could read all data from the tests, and do some
                    calculations and analysis. Then the results would be presented in tables and graphs that the user
                    can understand. A video of how this algorithm works is on my linked in page.
